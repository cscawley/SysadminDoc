Link the site on nginx.
```
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/server-block-01 /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/server-block-01
```

# SSL #

Generate a strong key for the certificate.
```
openssl genrsa -out webapp.key 4096
```

Take that key and use it to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
```
openssl req -out webapp.csr -key webapp.key -new -sha256
```

Submit the CSR to a third party signer. Copy the resulting CRT and Intermediate CRT. Create them and cat them.

The issuing authority may have signed the server certificate using an intermediate certificate that is not present in the certificate base of well-known trusted certificate authorities which is distributed with a particular browser. In this case the authority provides a bundle of chained certificates which should be concatenated to the signed server certificate. The server certificate must appear before the chained certificates in the combined file

```
cat webapp_crt.crt intermediate.crt > webapp.crt
```

If you had no authority to offer a trusted signature for some reason... you could sign it yourself untrusted:

```
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
```

### Generate a strong dhparam certificate

```
openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 4096
```
